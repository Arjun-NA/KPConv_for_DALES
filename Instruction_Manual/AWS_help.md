# AWS Commands for EC2 instance
 
Basics and Advanced commands which is useful for setting up and running Amazon AMI EC2 instance.   

## Managing External Storage  
  
For more detailed guide [try here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-partition-and-format-storage-devices-in-linux)  
Command used to list all usable storage  
```
sudo lsblk
```  
Some versions of lsblk will print all of this information if we type:
```
sudo lsblk --fs
```
Command for creating partition
```
sudo parted /dev/sda mklabel gpt
sudo parted -a opt /dev/sda mkpart primary ext4 0% 100%
```  

Create a Filesystem on the New Partition
```
sudo mkfs.ext4 -L datapartition /dev/sda1
``` 
  

## Mounting an extra storage eg: HDD storage  

Create the mounting point using the following commands  
```
cd /
sudo mkdir media/NewVol/
```
Adding storage to the running instance. (You should have already done the volume attach to the instance from the AWS Management Console)
```
cd /
sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/[storage_name] /media/NewVol/
``` 
<br>
[storage_name] 
: This should be found out on your own. This can be found out by checking command `lsblk` or the directory list using the ``` ls``` command in /dev/ folder before and after you attach the volume (Notice the change in it) to the instance via AWS Management Console.
<br>some common names look like nvme1n1 or SDF or XDF or XVDF where F is variable
  


## Copying files from/to s3 
```
aws s3 cp filename_from filename_to 
```

## Copying folder from local storage to AWS s3 
As the usage of cp does not help in copying folder from the instance to the s3 cloud we utilize sync <br>
```
aws s3 sync folder_to_copy S3_URL 
```
